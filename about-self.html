							<h2>About myself</h2>
							
						</header>
						
						<span class="image featured"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/padsC2v.jpg" alt="" /></span>
						
						<p>My name is Angus Pollmann, 24, born and raised in Chile. My mother language is Spanish, but all my work is in english so i'll just stick with it for consistency.</p>
						
						<h3>Formation</h3>
						<p>My studies are an uncompleted (currently last year) university career and self-taught. There are no "bachelor degree" in Chile, but an equivalent of my university career would be a bachelor of business information systems (science in information technology + business study).
						<br>
						<br>
						On my own i've studied as much as i can, programming, game design, writting, psychology, philosophy, and will keep learning as long as i have time.</p>
						<h3>Why game design?</h3>
						<p>I want to dedicate myself to make games, because i love it. I can't stop thinking about it, i don't ever get tired of it. Doesn't matter if it is a mechanic, some balance that needs to be done, a new idea for the story or about the player experience, i love the game as a whole experience. If i'm to do something for the rest of my life, i'll do something i love, doesn't matter how much i have to work for it.
						<br>
						<br>
						I understand that to be a great game designer means to learn about everything, and i'm not afraid, but thrilled.</p>
						<h3>Things i like</h3>
						<p>I don't really discriminate videogames by genre or where they come from, as long as they're good.
						<br>
						<br>
						I specially like videogames that are immersive, that allow you to experience like you're living in another place, another time, another reality. That kind of game that teaches you something about yourself, about the world, about people, that once you've finished it, you're something more. For me, great games will make the players feel like they've lived many lives.
						<br>
						<br>
						And i also like movies, series (don't care if they're occidental or not), books (specially sci-fi), comics and, of course, Board Games.
