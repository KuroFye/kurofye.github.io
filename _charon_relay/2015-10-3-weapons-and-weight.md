title: Weapons and weight
---
I decided to limit the weapon talents to specific classes, and give bonus damage with them, instead of limiting which gun characters can carry, this way they can carry whatever they want but it will not be as effective, thus pushing them to use what they are supposed or just use them as backup.

Weapon talents should also include a weight reduction to further hinder the capability of using specialized weapons in power-based classes, like engineers, adepts and sentinels.
