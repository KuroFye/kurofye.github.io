title: Character growth
---
I had a HUGE overlook at the very beginning while designing the primary/secondary stats, i didn’t relate them to expected character growth, equipment limitations, equipment bonuses, powers and expected damage output, so now i’m examining them over again. 

Now i realize how important is to fail faster, i should have just built builds right away and start testing the expected damage and so, i didn’t started where i should have started, which is the combat itself and then built around, starting with the weapons that i just did yesterday night, and so i have more work. At last i won’t forget this experience and will help me get better.

I considered every variable i could think of, and that led to a slight modification to the formula i was using to calculate the damage each power should deal, and i considered the weapon’s power growth (which is up to +9 to the damage), and it actually makes the weapons much more powerful, the only way to counter it is to reduce the recharge time of the power, so that should change over the character’s growth.

PC like Infiltrators should deal more or less the same damage as a soldier, meaning the weapon damage difference (that is multiplied by the turns of recharge the powers have) is 0, which is a problem, because that is the only thing that was multiplied by the amount of power recharge turns, rendering it meaningless, thus making powerful powers break the damage bar, independently of how many recharge turns it has. 

SO, soldiers should have powers that deal damage too, so if the power the Infiltrator used has a far too long recharge time, the soldier will eventually step up to the damage dealt by the Infiltrator using his own Combat Powers, so making all classes deal almost the exact same damage output.
