Reviewing the basic things you want to do can really refresh your perspective. I played ME1, 2 and 3 a bit, and some XCOM. I will be using the XCOM classes skills, some as Stunts, some as Powers.

There are 4 XCOM classes, not counting MECH, mainly because his skills just make him more usefull and powerfull, he does not posses any particular ability like Suppression Fire, for example. I will be using most of the abilities, be passive or not, and restrict some of them to classes and others to weapons, or both for what matters (suppression fire should not be done with a shotgun, for example). Sadly, there isn’t anything like a mage or a biotic except for the Psionic, but it’s a subclass, anyone can be a Psionic, so not really a Character Construction there.

I decided that the weapons that does not use Thermal Clips will be available all the time and they will not have something very complicated. They will not deal less damage, but if they use any kind of double attack (like Rapid Fire, or double reaction shot) they will get overheated and thus will not be usable the next round of combat. That’s it. They will also be weak against powers that overheat weapons, and Thermal Clip dependant weapons won’t.

Shields, i also decided, will start their recovery time if the character does not get any damage done in a full round, thus receiving some token or mark. If, for another full round, he does not, again, receive any kind of damage, during the Recovery Phase (which will be a phase at the end of every round of combat to check for shield and health regeneration effects) all the character’s shield will be completely recovered. There will not be any partial recovery during a turn. For this, i’m forced to make shields very low, i’ll explain why.

During first mission of the entire Mass Effect, Jenkins gets shredded by 3 drones (that shoots as hard as any troop). In ME3 multiplayer, if you get rounded by 3 enemies, even 3 Geth Trooper, you’ll probably go down in what would be 2 or 3 Rounds of combat in the Charon Relay. This means a fully shielded character should get killed in 2 rounds of combat if catch out of cover, i should aim for this when starting to test the combat mechanics.

I also decided that a Melee Biotic with a sword would totally make a Jedi Knight, and that maybe a Sentinel specialization should be a melee class with a sustained “Technological Lightning”, just so the game has Siths too. If you are going to make an RPG with space magic then you have to go StarWars.
