I was about to start making the Stunts when i found out that i really don’t know what should i use as Stunt and what as Power, so i’ll just write everything down (Mass Effect powers, XCOM abilities and AGE talents and character growth skills) and compare them all to decide.

After many hours of taking notes of powers in ME, XCOM and AGE system, i decided that if i just made a talent for every skill or school/ability, i would probably end up with a hundred talents, and that would really make character creation a huge mess. So, for the sake of simplicity, i’ll make every power like a Dragon Age Magic, and group powers in big groups for a talents to boost them up.

I put Grenades to be a Talent, and each different grenade to be learned in a schematic, the way poisons are learned in Dragon Age. Ammo powers, like cryo ammo, would not be a Power at all but a Mod, as the “all team ammo” is a skill that would require a leader, like shepard, but there are no leaders in the RPG. The mods will be available to be bought or made like Runes, in a Weapon Mod Talent.

I went through all Mass Effect powers and talents. All of them. I ended up deciding for 14 Biotic Powers and 18 Tech powers, plus 3 Combat powers, and classified them all in “schools”, like magic schools.

There are more powers, of course, but they were too specific for each character in the Multiplayer to whom they belonged to, so i decided to add them as Specialization skills. I’ll put them in the schools too.

I did all the stunts, Common, Melee, Ranged, Power, Tech and Biotic stunts. power stunts can be used with tech, biotic and combat powers.
In the end i decided that i would make the power Prime for power combos a Stunt, and then it can be exploded by a Detonating power. I’ll make some boost for the explosions in talents or as part of characters growth.

I also went through all the XCOM abilities and put them either in queue to be merged into a Talent (i have not done Talents jet) or as part of a class growth skill.

The last thing i made were 2 specialization ideas for each Class. They are generic Specialization, as not every character can become an Asari Hunter or a Krogan Warlord, right? i’ll make those at the end.

It was a long day going through all the powers, talents, AGE skills character growth (which i listed btw, forgot to mention), but i organized everything and finally, after disassembling all 5 games, it begins to take shape.
