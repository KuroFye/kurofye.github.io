Did most Major and Minor actions, including the XCOM Hunker Down and Overwatch, changed some of the others. 

The most important thought i had was about the Medi-Gel, mostly because it’s very different in each game. I decided to use it more close to what it is in the first Mass Effect. There will be an individual recovery time for each player between the use of medigel, that will depend on the character’s constitution. Why? because it’s lore-wise more correct. Medi-Gel heals almost any injury, but it has painkillers to get the soldier going, and your body can only withstand a certain amount of it, so if you overdose it, you’ll go numb. This further increases the difference between high-constitution self-healing characters and those who simply don’t, just because health itself is very low compared to Shields, thus leaving it rather useless unless it supports other mechanics.

Healing is very different between Mass Effect 1 and 3, and that’s because Reaper Invasion made the universe go in a “Survival mode”, thus, i made 2 different Armor Technology. The Pre-Reaper invasion give the user a Healing Factor (small liberations of Medi-Gel) but can’t self revive themselves when they start Dying. Reaper Invasion Armors does not use Healing on wounds but save the Medi-Gel for only when the character is Dying. This can be done even by the Dying character. This, i hope, will help give a more exploring-the-galaxy focus to the Pre-Reaper setting, in a way of feeling more safe to just “go and make the jump for it, you’ll heal anyway” and a “if i make a mistake everyone’s going to die here” feeling to the Reaper Invasion.

I will not put the “Heal him without using any Medi-Gel” option there is in Mass Effect 3 because, as gameplay mechanic, is all right, it helps so you can’t abuse Medi-Gel and just charge every turret with the vanguard because no one will go revive you, but lore-wise makes no sense. The single-player logic is supported around the leader, which can’t be in a role-playing game because of the great deal of troubles it could create.

The Healing will be limited by the weight and price of the medigel, which is not as free to get, thus forcing the players to spend their credits on supplies, and the limited weight they can carry on them all the time.
