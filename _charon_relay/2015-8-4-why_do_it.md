title: Why do this adaptation?
---
Well, first of all, obviously, because i love the Mass Effect Universe.

Second, i have seen many Mass Effect RPG adaptation projects, so full of rules and specifications and so very open to exploit the game and the character creation that i really didn’t felt the sensation Mass Effect should give you, the adventure, the discovery, the unknown, the broke of what you thought was right, the betrayal of the people you thought supported and helped you, a vast universe full of opportunities, and all i saw was math.

After more or less a year of playing Dragon Age RPG and getting to know the AGE system, i understood what it really meant “focus on the adventure, focus on the players, focus on the heroes that bring light to this world”.
It is really a wonderful and unique Universe and playing and sharing RPG with your group of friends, and lead everyone to a whole Universe, together? that is what i want to share with everyone.

### Mechanics Developmen
I actually started doing this on august 2, a whole day trying to figure out the difference between the AGE system in Fantasy Age and Dragon Age RPG, the impact of having 1 or 2 stats for the same purpose (probability to hit and damage dealt) and the repercussion of the Primary/Secondary stats. 
For Warriors in Fantasy Age is separated as Strength for damage and Fighting for chance, but in DA you only need Strength, the same happens with Mages and Magic in Dragon Age, but it is Intelligence you use in Fantasy Age, which also has a repercussion in Narrative encounters, so the more powerful the AGE mage is, the more social skills he gets, which does not happen to the DA mage, considering the variety of spells and probabilities they have i find this quite correct, AGE spells are not so powerfull.

I decided to cast myself for the AGE approach, though i replaced Fighting for Biotics. This is because Fighting makes melee characters growth slower, so they keep growing in pair with the others, they were way more fast than Mages and Rogues, but a melee attack in Mass Effect leaves the character completely open to fire, not to mention the “getting close” involved, that could be completely suicidal in most situations as you have to enter your enemy barricade/cover, so i decided to let the Melee be strong and add Biotics to lay them low a bit, even though they are not as powerful as DA mages, they can still take a bunch of enemies in a single punch.
I also decided to make 6 classes instead of turning one basic class (like biotic) and then approach to another to make an intermediary class (like soldier to engineer to make infiltrator), mainly because of the primary-secondary stats system, which is a way to force players into building the character in a certain way to fulfill a determined set of roles in a group, otherway would have meant making changes in the primary-secondary stats or making a class with two different sets of primary-secondary stats (from soldier to vanguard would keep soldier primary and from biotic to vanguard would keep biotic primaries).

This is all for the first report.
