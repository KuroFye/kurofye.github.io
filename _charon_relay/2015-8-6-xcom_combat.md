Decided that the regular AGE battle system was just not quite right with the way a gunfire combat is played out, so i decided to take the X-COM: Enemy Unknown game mechanic as a baseline for the combat encounters in Mass Effect.

## What does this means?

It means some new Major and Minor actions and a few new mechanics. I promise they will not be boring and hard to keep an eye on, as that is my main focus for this project. The main “focus” for this will be that the units must be behind cover or risk themselves to get killed quickly, giving great bonuses to units shooting unprotected units, thus making teamwork a must and greatly forcing the need of tactics like flanking the enemy, that are close to ineffective in the regular AGE system.

This will add actions like Hunker Down or Overwatch from the XCOM mechanics, and will replace actions like Prepare or Defense actions that makes little to no sense in a gunfire encounter.

At this point i have not decided if some covers will be able to be blown by some weapons or powers. Giving the units the ability to break them will eventually lead to a coverless fight, but doing nothing against cover could lead to a boring shooting between barricades.
