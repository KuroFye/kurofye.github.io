Further modifications to the damage formula now allow me to try it for power-focused classes and weapon/powers classes at the same time and see how much damage they deal at level 1 and at level 20 (approximately obviously).

If we are to consider infiltrator/vanguards carry the same weapons as soldiers and that first two classes can use powers, combat powers for soldier must make him deal more damage, +2D6 to be precise, every 2 turns or +1D6 every turn, to keep up with the damage the powers of van/infil deal. 

I now realize that upon endgame, soldier’s damage will surpass the damage dealt with the power so they need a boost, -1 recharge for 2 and 3 recharge powers and +3 damage to those who don’t recharge, well, i’m testing every power damage with the function and making notes on every power, then i’ll compare them (when i gather enough) to reach a better function for damage that do not include heavy recharges. Oh of course i’ve been making recharge times much lower, max. 3 rounds without using powers for infiltrators in overwhelming powers, but i still believe it’s too long so i need to find another way.

I also need to decide character movement’s in the board, weapon ranges and power ranges, all at once.
