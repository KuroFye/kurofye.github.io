Already designing the Character Sheet with the help and teachings of a friend while finishing up the last powers, and i realized i have to put all the powers in the structure i made for them which will take me a while but it’ll allow me to review them. 

Also i must specify the powers that leaves you out of cover, i completely forgot it.

After discussing it with my wife i decided to not use the regular “Paragon/Renegade” choices, i mean i will put them but they will not be exactly like Mass Effect. 

Every decision you take (every important one at last) has a Paragon or Renegade points assigned, meaning ruthless and diplomatic, but there are choices where actually none of them is paragon or renegade, they just are (like deciding what to do with the Geth in Legion’s loyalty mission). 

If you put the paragon in one side, the game already made the moral choice for you, “this one is good”, but i understand that not doing so in important game choices conflicts with gameplay mechanics.

So i decided that Paragon and Renegade will not be Good and Evil, they will be “reputation” points that i’ll encourage to give only in situations where you decided to solve things by killing, fighting or intimidating instead of knocking out, talking or persuading, so everyone that knows you will heard that you are “ruthless”, not necessarily evil. 

So, i’ll improve it with another set of points, the Fame points, like in Red Dead Redemption. Fame could be InFame too, so that paragon or renegade is just an approach and fame decides if you are viewed as “evil” or “good”, but you get to decide which one, depending on what you do rather than what you say, being a criminal or a savior.
