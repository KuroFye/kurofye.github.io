I finished the Tech Powers, it took me a lot of time but i ended up with 64 powers, including utility and combat focused powers.

I only based them on the powers already in the game, i still have ideas so i can build some more, but i want to start playing already so i’ll move out to Biotic powers and build more powers later.

I had a lot of time figuring out how much damage the powers should deal, so i was forced to make a formula to establish damage per turn, based on how much damage a soldier could do, so i don’t break the game with too much or too low damage. It was rather hard and consumed quite some time but it seems that the Dragon Age magics follow the same damage function, which gives me hope that my version of Mass Effect won’t be so easy to break.
