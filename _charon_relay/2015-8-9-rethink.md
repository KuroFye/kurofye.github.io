I played Mass Effect 1 a bit, took notes on how did the Shield system worked, the power recharge and the weapon’s overheat. 

I also played ME3 multiplayer a while, and i counted the time of every action we made. I decided that each round of combat would last only 6 seconds instead of the original 12 i thought, and that the non-thermal clip-dependant weapons would have a much simpler system, it’s just not worth the complicated mechanic. 

I will re think about the recharge in shields, barriers, health and powers. Even though i already wrote the general actions any XCOM soldier can make, i didn’t used the ones for each class, maybe i can assign them to a weapon talent, like with Suppression Fire. 

I will make Power Combo feasible, but not as powerful and easy to make like it is in ME3, and not available at the beginning.
