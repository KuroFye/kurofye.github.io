title: Developer log explanation
summary: What's with the devlog?
---
I started on this project on 2015/8/4, didn't had a site back then, but kept a log anyway. 

The dates of the devlog will be rather off, but they're what i did back then, when i still knew little about design, didn't had a website and didn't knew where to start.

This project took me much more time than i could have imagined, and looking back, it might have not been the best choice to start designing, as a programmer it would have taken me much less time to just build a small video game.

But i don't regret it, i learned a great deal, it was way off of my area of knowledge and still managed to make something good, and i'm proud of my work. I've seen plenty of other adaptations that just mimic the Mass Effect mechanics by adapting ME to the base system they were working on, and not the other way around (at last not without breaking it or leaving it too narrative-focused). Not saying they're bad or wrong, but i didn't feel the Mass Effect experience with it, i believe they didn't had the time or were not willing to spend so much.

So it had to be me, someone else might have gotten it wrong.
