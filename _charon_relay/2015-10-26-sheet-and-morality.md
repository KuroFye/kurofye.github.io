title: Charater sheet and morality
---
The main Character Sheet for casual game is completely done, also made a power card (very likely the ones found in DA for the magics) and started doing the back of the character sheet, which is optional. 

It includes a character biography, all the talents learned, the powers, a space to write things learned (like diagrams or blueprints for weapon mods, grenades, traps, etc), titles earned or organizations the character belongs or other relationships, its a rather free space. And the Honor/Fame bar.

I still have to decide and write down proper rules for the system, as i watched Extra Credits (youtube channel, great for new developers) i understood that it must be a Choice Bar, not a consequence one, you need to know what you are doing, and yet, there is so much potential to it. 

ME uses it mostly as a Persuasion roll, but it does not need to be like that in a game where you already make a roll for it, should it only give bonuses? i don’t think so, it should be something you can escalate, something to work towards, there have to be a point to it.

Why do you level up? to get even stronger and be able to fight thoughter battles. Why? because thoughter battles mean more complex and/or impossible situations, it opens up more of the world and what you can do, how you can change it.

Role playing is all about interacting with the world, and leveling up only allows you to interact with it further, defeat bigger monsters, speak with more influential people, explore uncharted and dangerous places, all of that by increasing the player’s stats, but how does the world sees you? that’s the main reason i believe is behind the Paragon/Renegade system, and thus must have a progressing reward system based on it.

I gave it a lot of thought and i’ll set Paragon and Renegade as independant bars that will level up as any character would, given a certain amount of XP it will go to the next level and it will be treated like an Ability to do “Morality” test.

For example, you want to stop two people arguing and they are about to start a fight, once per encounter you can make a Morality test (whether Paragon or Renegade) to change this, either by persuading them to fight or to whatever it is you came up with, and instead of using Communication or any other Ability, you use the level of your Morality bar you choose. Why not simply try a Communication (persuasion) check you ask? well first of all, because it is somewhat of an icon and not implementing it would be a let down but doing some complex system only for it would be a adding too much complexity to the game

Second, because it would allow the heroes to have another chance and something to work towards to, as most people only level the combat-related abilities this would force them to search and actually take this kind of decisions, adding a little extra incentive to the roleplaying part of the game, and third because a “morality” test means more than just speaking, it could also involve a gesture, an action like firing a bullet to the heat ventilation while nobody expects it, put medigel into someone that is about to collapse; the GM should give you this information when the player asks for a morality check (the GM should say for example “this Turian is about to freak out and start shooting, you could use your check to use some medigel and calm him down” or “there is a barrel that could explode if you shoot at it, and is right next to the threatening krogan”), giving an effective turn in the situation.

There will be another stat called Fame that will mean how well known you are in the galaxy, it will be given in different situations where no paragon/renegade yet significantly important decisions were made, and it will unlock plot events, different items in the stores will be available for you, factions will start to take notice of your actions, common people will fear or respect you, and you’ll be able to go places you could not go before, like the Afterlife in Omega or other restricted places, you’ll get discounts, and so on. It’ll be something the players can also work towards to, will restrict their advance in terms of equipment and items and can also work towards connections with different plots and adventures, all in one.

I also added the corresponding bars to the character sheet. All of this should be optional, of course, i’ll make a tutorial adventure to try all this.
