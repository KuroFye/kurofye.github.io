Finally i decided the details about the Medi-Gel, each player will be able to carry a maximum of 2 Medi-Gel packs to freely use in battle, thus limiting it to revive teammates or tight situations.

More Medi-Gel can be carry by the players though, but not brought to battle. This should also be limited with special canisters that can carry a maximum of 2 more medi-gel uses, that doesn’t have to be used at once to replenish. All this is only to focus on the idea that replenishing health is not the way to support your team to last longer, but only a way to save them from bleeding out, the equivalent of healing in Mass Effect are barriers and shield boost, not in any way the Medi-Gel.

Health growth will be very thin, Constitution+1, with minimum of 1 (for those with negative Constitution), but there will be a shield growth based on constitution, bigger, like HP growth in the AGE system. This will obviously give more resistance to the characters, so i will boost every weapon’s base damage, so battles don’t last so long.

Finished the Heat Release from the weapons that does not use Thermal Clips, there should be Stunts related to this.

My wife had the idea to make tech, combat, biotic and common stunts separated, and how to handle the thermal clip logic. This will make easier the use of the stunts (and to decide which i can and cannot use).

Today progress was mostly deciding what would be a skill/power and what will be a Stunt. I decided that all the Combat Powers will be that, Combat Powers, and not Stunts. I still have to decide the Shield and Health self recovery. I am very, VERY doubtful about creating the power-combo mechanic from ME3, because it can be exploited from a well coordinated group to make a chain reaction and induce a non-stop chain of power combos, and it’s quite hard to regulate, specially because Role Playing groups can be bigger than 5 or 6 players, so it would be really easy to trigger one.
