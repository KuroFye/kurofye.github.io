I realize what i was missing. Class Function. Deal damage, maintain position, support, suppress enemy advance, etc. 

I also remembered that, for example, Tali, as quarian machinist, which is an Engineer, dropped the idea Medicine to use a Shotgun. It would be too much to make a special class for quarians, turians, etc, so i’ll just have to give players that choice.

I investigated weapons today, real life weapon stances, weapons in ME and real tactics, i have to make at last 7 styles for weapons, but they can’t be like “shotgun talent, pistol talent”, because those are just for 1 weapon and do not represents any style nor a technique for shooting, technically if you receive weapon training, what impedes you to just grab an assault rifle and shoot like you would a shotgun? i need to classify weapons and find a way to divide them.
