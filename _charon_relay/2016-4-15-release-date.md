Life is far from predictable, and these have been a lot of crazy months. Still here we are! finally with a release, with a version of the game i'm actually confortable with.

I'm truly happy, tired, and very grateful to finally be able to share this with the world, and i can't wait to see people's reaction to it!

All the links in the Download section have been updated. From now on this section will be updated each time there's something new with the project, how often it happes depends on the amount of time i manage to get and the amount of people interested in it.

If anyone has ANY doubt, question, comment or anything, please feel free to contact me to my email or add me on Facebook, i'll be more than happy to reply.
