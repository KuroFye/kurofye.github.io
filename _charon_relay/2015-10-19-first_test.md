Today was testing the core mechanics and combat flow day, it worked nice and flowed as intended. 

Soldier, engineer, vanguard, infiltrator and Sentinel were all used and well, the players lost, but it was mostly because they were 1 man short and the engineer relied solely on the automats, so no big support there, ultimately it was 2 men short, and nobody moved to take out the snipers, great try though.

Defense bonus on cover/non-cover was good, hunker-down enemies where almost impossible to hit, which is what was intended. Chance to hit needs some review, even thou the defense as it is (6 + dexterity and +6 for cover) was actually pretty accurate to the chance in FAGE and ME.

The only-make-powers-when-stunts for enemies works great so the GM doesn’t have to rely on recharge dices. 

Infiltrators are rather OP, so i definitely have to restrain their ability to shoot in short-range. Also crits where very few (only 2 in the game).

Still lots of work to do, movement, weapon ranges, calibrate and calculate everything, but the core is great so i’ll work rather fast with the rest of the mechanics. The game got a good approval so it was a nice start, community was hyped by a photo of the character sheet, it was very good for motivation, idea of my wife <3 .
