## Character Sheets

The character sheet better fits a legal size print. How to better use the sheet is explained in the book.

## Extra sheets

The game was meant to be played more like a board game, as there are a lot of things to have in mind, so being able to see all you have or can do is great help.

### Power sheet

Made to be printed in a legal sized paper and used side-ways. Holds reference for 9 powers and space to leave a Tech-power recharge dice, Biotic-power recharge dice, how much ammo you got in your weapon and the bleeding/medigel cooldown time. 

Keep in mind that only Sentinels use both recharge dices, and that when you're bleeding you move your recharge dice to the Medigel area.

Reference for powers are meant to be already calculated. For example, if you deal 3D6+ Weapon Damage with a power, don't write "Weapon Damage", just put the numbers (so 5D6+4 for example). This does mean you'll have to update your powers, but that's only when you level up or obtain a more powerful weapon.

### Playmat

Also meant to be printed in legal sized paper and used side-ways. It's just to note the HP, ammo clips, medigel and grenades in battle, works wonders if you plastify it and use a whiteboard pen.

### Quick reference cards

Meant to be printed like the others. It's meant to be filled by the GM when creating characters to be NPCs or enemies and keep the most important statistics at hand. There is a large version for specially complex enemies, like Banshees or other bosses.

### Combat Resume sheet

Meant to be given one copy to each player and GM, as it holds a resume of most of the game's combat rules and stunts.

## Game Master Screen

I'm very sorry it's ugly, i'll try to improve the spacing, but it's meant to be printed horizontally and has most rules, including every stunt and effect. 

It only has the "inside" of a GM Screen because i don't have any artwork that would fit the panoramic image needed, would anyone have one or wishes to draw one for the screen, please send it to my email and i'll be very happy to add it and thank you in any way you want.
