##Core Rulebook (PDF)

Right now the book is not yet finished, but is playable. Chapters 1 to 5 have all the rules and powers, but the remaining chapters have more on how to build a campaign, how to carry combat for the GM, the lore in case you want to print it for your personal use (or don't have a stable internet) and some more advice.

###Disclaimer

Please keep in mind that it's meant to be freely distributed as a work of a fan.

As for the images, i've personally asked permission to each and every single artist, but not all of them has sent a response. Currently 69% of the pictures are from authors that have agreed to appear in the book, and 63% of all the artists have answered. They are all credited, even the ones that still have not answered. If you own any of this images and don't want your work to be on the book, please send me an email and i'll fix it right away.

##Character Sheets

The character sheet better fits a legal size print. How to better use the sheet is explained in the book.

##Extra sheets

The game was meant to be played more like a board game, as there are a lot of things to have in mind, so being able to see all you have or can do is great help.

###Power sheet

Made to be printed in a legal sized paper and used side-ways. Holds reference for 9 powers and space to leave a Tech-power recharge dice, Biotic-power recharge dice, how much ammo you got in your weapon and the bleeding/medigel cooldown time. 

Keep in mind that only Sentinels use both recharge dices, and that when you're bleeding you move your recharge dice to the Medigel area.

Reference for powers are meant to be already calculated. For example, if you deal 3D6+ Weapon Damage with a power, don't write "Weapon Damage", just put the numbers (so 5D6+4 for example). This does mean you'll have to update your powers, but that's only when you level up or obtain a more powerful weapon.

###Playmat

Also meant to be printed in legal sized paper and used side-ways. It's just to note the HP, ammo clips, medigel and grenades in battle, works wonders if you plastify it and use a whiteboard pen.
