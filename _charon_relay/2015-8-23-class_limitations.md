title: Class limitations
---
I had a thought of “why adepts don’t learn Charge? they are literally the masters of Biotics” and “why don’t engineers use Tactical Cloak? they are literally the masters of technology”. 

Then it hit me “if they did, their combat role would change completely”, but the problem is one class does not have a single combat role, and once they hit a specialization, they could even gain a new combat role (as happens with Arcane Mage in DA). I need to make a combat flow diagram with each class role and think of the possibility of other roles IF specializations were to apply.

All right, like in ME2, Sentinels->Tech Armor (with the possibility to transform it into something else, like a Shield), Soldiers->Boost (like adrenaline shot, but generic), Infiltrators->Cloak, Vanguards->Charge, but adepts and engineers...i’ll think it through. 

Checking other games, actually not everything makes sense (like recovering plasmid from water in Bioshock), maybe i’ll just have to forget about the logic with some things to favor the gameplay, and then come up with an excuse. You play because it's fun not because it makes sense anyway, even though is great if it's both.
