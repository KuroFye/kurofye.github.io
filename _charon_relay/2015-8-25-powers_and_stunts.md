title: Biotic powers
---
All right, i finished the Talents today, also i finished the leveling-up skills for the Engineer and the Adept and the Stunt Bonuses for everyone. 

Put quite a few Specialization concepts and dispatched most of the XCOM skills i want to use, i still have around 10 to go. Also i added some rules regarding Biotics.

Giving that biotics have changed a lot from the books, comics, first mass effect and the last 2 mass effect games, i came to a common ground.

There are stunts to directly affect the target, beneath the shield, so not always a possibility. Also, everyone makes a Test against the power of the biotics but Shielded characters receive a bonus to resist them. Characters pushed to a wall by a biotic power receive damage directly related to how much potential energy was left, to represent someone slamming his foe against the wall with sheer biotic force.

Finally, cover will protect the characters from area-of-effect powers like Flamer, not single-target powers like Light Throw, Overload or Incinerate. Drawing the concept and Battlefield function of each class really helped me focus on what the class was for and what they should and should not use.
