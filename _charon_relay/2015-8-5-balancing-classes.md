Finished the classes, balanced the Infiltrator a bit. 

Every class has limitations, set by Primary and Secondary stats, that way, you “force” the player to grow where he is intended, not to wherever he wants, because the game is made for classes to be played a certain way or just plainly choose another class. Of course, every class can be developed in at last 3 different ways, and some of them gives them free stats to raise and personalize even further the characters, the limitations just means you can’t make an Infiltrator like a soldier or like an engineer, if you completely forget about weapon damage or technological effects, then you just choose the wrong class.
