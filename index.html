							<h3>Welcome to my portfolio!</h3>
							<p>I am a game designer who loves making game system/mechanics/gameplay, be either video game or board game. I use my design, writing and technical background to look at each part of the game and see how it affects the player's experience.</p>
							<p>I like working in collaborative environments where everyone is passionate about what they do and are open to discuss and criticize any game design decision, regardless of the area they belong to.</p>
