							<h2>Mass Effect - The Charon Relay</h2>
							<p>Posted 16 Apr 2016</p>

								<p>Made only for the fans of both tabletop RPG and Mass Effect games, this adaptation is based on the Fantasy AGE system by <a href="http://greenronin.com/">Green Ronin</a> and is used for  Dragon Age, Fantasy AGE, Blue Rose and Titansgrave games.</p>

<h3 id="what-do-i-need-to-play">What do i need to play?</h3>
<p>I don’t own any license here, except for what i put together, so it’s all free, just make sure to link whoever you send the game to this page c: .</p>

<p>To play, you’ll need the book (in the download section to your right), character and power sheets (both in the end of the book, and also in a separated link in the download section).</p>

<p>Also, you’ll need some dice, three six-sided dice, at last three ten-sided dice (they’re actually optional, but help to make the combat flow a bit faster), and a 20 sided dice (for the critical hits).</p>

<p>A lot of people like playing with figurines and a map, and i really recommend it as it helps visualize the battlefield. There are no rules for this, except that it should be squared. I understand hexagonal grids are great for distances, but they don’t work well when cover is involved.</p>

<h3 id="games-that-inspired-the-adaptation">Games that inspired the adaptation</h3>
<p>The most obvious are Fantasy AGE and Mass Effect 1. There are also a few differences between the tabletop Dragon Age RPG and the Fantasy AGE that allowed me to understand better the game mechanics and system.</p>

<p>The combat for the game is based on the XCOM gameplay and Mass Effect 3 mechanics (ME1 and ME3 combat mechanics are very different).</p>

<h3 id="whats-the-game-about">What’s the game about?</h3>
<p>The original Fantasy AGE is meant for a less-tactical faster-peaced gameplay in Combat, Exploration and Interpretation encounters, and is set in a little-to-none technology ambientation (except Titansgrave, but it’s still scarce in the world).</p>

<p>This adaptation has completely different classes, talents, specializations and magics/arcana (now called Powers). The gameplay or rather how the game flows is also different, giving a feeling of a more cover-to-cover shooting tactical game (much like XCOM).</p>

<p>Also there are Shield points besides the Health Points for characters and Powers only recharge, they don’t consume anything equivalent to Mana or Magic Points. This is to make the game mechanics reflect more of the Mass Effect world.</p>

<p>There are also Weight mechanics and non-combat related talent points besides regular talent points. These are meant to guide the player towards a more balanced and role-specific character, yet it does not limit the player’s choices on how to build his character.</p>

<p>All these changes and new mechanics and changes do require some more ruling than the original Fantasy AGE, but to keep the original spirit of a fast-paced and easy-to-learn game, most of these new rules are common bonuses or only apply when improving your character.</p>

<p>This is the front cover made by <a href="http://martingust.deviantart.com/">Martin Gust</a> for this adaptation, nothing gives more life to a game than great artwork, thanks a lot man &lt;3</p>
