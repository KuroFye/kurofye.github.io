												<h3>Mass Effect - The Charon Relay</h3>
												<p>Made only for the fans of both tabletop RPG and Mass Effect games, this adaptation is based on the Fantasy AGE system by <a href="http://greenronin.com/">Green Ronin</a> and is used for  Dragon Age, Fantasy AGE, Blue Rose and Titansgrave games.</p>

<h3 id="what-do-i-need-to-play">What do i need to play?</h3>
<p>I don’t own any license here, except for what i put together, so it’s all free, just make sure to link whoever you send the game to this page c: .</p>

<p>To play, you’ll need the book (in the download section to your right), character and power sheets (both in the end of the book, and also in a separated link in the download section).</p>

<p>Also, you’ll need some dice, three six-sided dice, at last three ten-sided dice (they’re actually optional, but help to make the combat flow a bit faster), and a 20 sided dice (for the critical hits).</p>

<p>A lot of people like playing with figurines and a map, and i really recommend it as it helps visualize the battlefield. There are no rules for this, except that it should be squared. I understand hexagonal grids are great for distances, but they don’t work well when cover is involved.</p>

<h3 id="games-that-inspired-the-adaptation">Games that inspired the adaptation</h3>
<p>The most obvious are Fantasy AGE and Mass Effect 1. There are also a few differences between the tabletop Dragon Age RPG and the Fantasy AGE that allowed me to understand better the game mechanics and system.</p>

<p>The combat for the game is based on the XCOM gameplay and Mass Effect 3 mechanics (ME1 and ME3 combat mechanics are very different).</p>

<h3 id="whats-the-game-about">What’s the game about?</h3>
<p>The original Fantasy AGE is meant for a less-tactical faster-peaced gameplay in Combat, Exploration and Interpretation encounters, and is set in a little-to-none technology ambientation (except Titansgrave, but it’s still scarce in the world).</p>

<p>This adaptation has completely different classes, talents, specializations and magics/arcana (now called Powers). The gameplay or rather how the game flows is also different, giving a feeling of a more cover-to-cover shooting tactical game (much like XCOM).</p>

<p>Also there are Shield points besides the Health Points for characters and Powers only recharge, they don’t consume anything equivalent to Mana or Magic Points. This is to make the game mechanics reflect more of the Mass Effect world.</p>

<p>There are also Weight mechanics and non-combat related talent points besides regular talent points. These are meant to guide the player towards a more balanced and role-specific character, yet it does not limit the player’s choices on how to build his character.</p>

<p>All these changes and new mechanics and changes do require some more ruling than the original Fantasy AGE, but to keep the original spirit of a fast-paced and easy-to-learn game, most of these new rules are common bonuses or only apply when improving your character.</p>

<p><span class="image featured"><img src="/images/charon_cover.jpg" alt="" /></span></p>

<p>This is the front cover made by <a href="http://martingust.deviantart.com/">Martin Gust</a> for this adaptation, nothing gives more life to a game than great artwork, thanks a lot man &lt;3</p>

												<h3>Downloads</h3>
												<p>Book in PDF and all extra sheets downloads</p>

<h2 id="core-rulebook-pdf">Core Rulebook (PDF)</h2>

<p>Finally the first release of the book! I truly welcome any question and/or feedback you may have, possitive and negative, so contact me on email or facebook c:</p>

<p>Here’s the link to the complete book, it has all the extra sheets and pages showed in this page attached at the end of the PDF, in case someone wants to print it, for personal use only.</p>

<p><span class="image"><img src="/images/portada_small.jpg" alt="" /></span></p>

<p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BxdntDYpu5XQdHVUdTJQU3haY0E/view?usp=sharing">Mass Effect-The Charon Relay</a> This link will get updated would anything change.</p>

<h3 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer</h3>

<p>Please keep in mind that it’s meant for personal use and it is in no way official or legal, it’s only the work of a fan. All rights belong to Electronics Arts, Bioware (for Mass Effect), Green Roning publishing and their respective owners.</p>

<p>As for the images, i’ve personally asked permission to each and every single artist. They are all credited in the first few pages of the book. If you own any of this images and don’t want your work to be on the book anymore, please send me an email and i’ll fix it right away.</p>

<h2 id="character-sheets">Character Sheets</h2>

<p>The character sheet better fits a legal size print. How to better use the sheet is explained in the book.</p>

<p><span class="image"><img src="/images/character_sheet_small.png" alt="" /></span></p>

<p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BxdntDYpu5XQRUpHamdGOHlkclU/view?usp=sharing">Charon Relay Character Sheet</a></p>

<h2 id="extra-sheets">Extra sheets</h2>

<p>The game was meant to be played more like a board game, as there are a lot of things to have in mind, so being able to see all you have or can do is great help.</p>

<h3 id="power-sheet">Power sheet</h3>

<p>Made to be printed in a legal sized paper and used side-ways. Holds reference for 9 powers and space to leave a Tech-power recharge dice, Biotic-power recharge dice, how much ammo you got in your weapon and the bleeding/medigel cooldown time.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that only Sentinels use both recharge dices, and that when you’re bleeding you move your recharge dice to the Medigel area.</p>

<p>Reference for powers are meant to be already calculated. For example, if you deal 3D6+ Weapon Damage with a power, don’t write “Weapon Damage”, just put the numbers (so 5D6+4 for example). This does mean you’ll have to update your powers, but that’s only when you level up or obtain a more powerful weapon.</p>

<p><span class="image"><img src="/images/power_sheet_small.jpg" alt="" /></span></p>

<p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BxdntDYpu5XQYUdSeXdaTzZrRWM/view?usp=sharing">Power sheet</a></p>

<h3 id="vertical-power-sheet">Vertical Power Sheet</h3>

<p>As requested i made a vertical power sheet, both letter and legal size.</p>

<p><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BxdntDYpu5XQSUh0WllqUDJ0UXc">Vertical Power Sheet - Letter</a></p>

<p><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BxdntDYpu5XQZWhQeDJvbnl4UE0">Vertical Power Sheet - Legal</a></p>

<h3 id="playmat">Playmat</h3>

<p>Also meant to be printed in legal sized paper and used side-ways. It’s just to note the HP, ammo clips, medigel and grenades in battle, works wonders if you plastify it and use a whiteboard pen.</p>

<p><span class="image"><img src="/images/playmat_small.png" alt="" /></span></p>

<p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BxdntDYpu5XQaW45ZWd4ZnMySjA/view?usp=sharing">Playmat sheet</a></p>

<h3 id="quick-reference-cards">Quick reference cards</h3>

<p>Meant to be printed like the others. It’s meant to be filled by the GM when creating characters to be NPCs or enemies and keep the most important statistics at hand. There is a large version for specially complex enemies, like Banshees or other bosses.</p>

<p><span class="image"><img src="/images/quick_reference.png" alt="" /></span></p>

<p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BxdntDYpu5XQQTJTX3NqUTk2Zzg/view?usp=sharing">Quick reference card regular</a></p>

<p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BxdntDYpu5XQTE5kZm1wNGlDdU0/view?usp=sharing">Quick reference card large</a></p>

<h3 id="combat-resume-sheet">Combat Resume sheet</h3>

<p>Meant to be given one copy to each player and GM, as it holds a resume of most of the game’s combat rules and stunts.</p>

<p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BxdntDYpu5XQV0dQeko5YlVaZFk/view?usp=sharing">Combat Resume sheet</a></p>

<h2 id="game-master-screen">Game Master Screen</h2>

<p>I’m very sorry it’s ugly, i’ll try to improve the spacing, but it’s meant to be printed horizontally and has most rules, including every stunt and effect.</p>

<p>It only has the “inside” of a GM Screen because i don’t have any artwork that would fit the panoramic image needed, would anyone have one or wishes to draw one for the screen, please send it to my email and i’ll be very happy to add it and thank you in any way you want.</p>

<p><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BxdntDYpu5XQTTVzOFg1SmNBSkE">Game Master Screen</a></p>

<h2 id="change-log">Change log</h2>
<p>A resume with any changes made to the book will be posted here when a new version shows up.</p>

<h3 id="3192017">3/19/2017</h3>

<p>Frezing Effect now keeps freezed targets for a fixed amount of turns instead of half willpower, as the effect was too complicated.</p>

<p>Shield Recharge passively during combat ruling deleted, because it incited passive gameplay and further extended the already long time of combat encounters. And was too difficult to keep track.</p>

<p>Power Combo now allows for the same target to be primed by more than one Explosion at the same time, because Power Combos are already difficult to make as is and are a Stunt after all, they’re supposed to be game changing.</p>

<p>Minor typos fixed as requested.</p>

<p>Added a vertical print-friendly power sheet in both letter and legal sizes as requested by a fan</p>

<p>Added an ugly, jet small, printable horizontal, letter-sized GM screen as requested by fan.</p>
